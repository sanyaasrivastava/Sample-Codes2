# Sample Codes
This is a repository of my codes that showcase my level of coding. The repository contains code in Stata, Python, and R, with each code demonstrating different skills.

Stata Code :
The Stata code (.do file)  in this repository demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, transformation, and causal analysis using Probit Regression. The code looks at conducting an impact evaluation to determine the effectiveness of a program, and it uses various Stata commands to clean and transform the data, and then runs a Probit regression to analyze the causal relationship.

Python Code : 
The Python code (.ipynb) in this repository showcases my skills in web scraping and automation. The code uses data from the Management Information System of Nutrition Centers and applies web scraping techniques to collect and analyze the data. The code also demonstrates my skills in automation, making the process of collecting data more efficient.

R Code :
The R code (.R) in this repository demonstrates my skills in data visualization and merging datasets. The code uses India's district-level shapefiles to build a heatmap that shows the incidence of malnutrition at the district level. The code also merges the district-level data with the National Family Health Survey data and addresses the unique identifier challenge that India faces due to differences in geographical boundaries and mapping schemas across different datasets.

Overall, this repository showcases my skills in various programming languages and techniques and highlights my ability to solve complex data challenges using different tools.
